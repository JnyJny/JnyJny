### Hey, it's me.

Husband, father, hacker, gamer, storyteller, egregeous guitarist,
hoplophile, space enthusiast, UNIX system programmer, scuba
diver, amatuer radio operator, remote-control neophyte, part-time
sci-fi snob, passing cartoonist, enthusiastic karateka, whiskey
drinker, acolyte of Schwa, semi-good pythonista, recovering
trombonist, mechanical keyboard afficiando, unapologetic Apple fanboi,
pickup truck driver, naked-eye exoplanet hunter and seriously grouchy
in the morning before the first cup of coffee.

I like making Python do weird and/or useful things. Useful is often optional.

I've written some articles on [Opensource.com](1) about programming in C and Python.
