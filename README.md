### Erik can be summed up... 

Husband, father, hacker, gamer, storyteller, egregious guitarist,
hoplophile, space exploration enthusiast, UNIX system programmer, scuba
diver, amatuer radio operator, remote-control neophyte, part-time
sci-fi snob, passing cartoonist, enthusiastic karateka, whiskey
drinker, acolyte of Schwa, semi-good pythonista, recovering
trombonist, mechanical keyboard aficionado, unapologetic Apple fanboi,
pickup truck driver, naked-eye exoplanet hunter and seriously grouchy
in the morning before the first cup of coffee.

I like making computers do weird and/or useful things. Useful is often optional.

I've written some articles on [Opensource.com][1] about programming in C and Python.

My handle, **JnyJny**, is a diminution of "Johnny Johnny" who is a character in the book "The Long Run" by Daniel Keys Moran.
