### A Brief Introduction to Me

Husband, father, hacker, gamer, storyteller, egregious guitarist,
hoplophile, space exploration enthusiast, UNIX system programmer, scuba
diver, amatuer radio operator, remote-control neophyte, part-time
sci-fi snob, passing cartoonist, enthusiastic karateka, whiskey
drinker, acolyte of Schwa, semi-good pythonista, recovering
trombonist, mechanical keyboard aficionado, unapologetic Apple fanboi,
pickup truck driver, naked-eye exoplanet hunter and seriously grouchy
in the morning before the first cup of coffee.

I like making computers do weird and/or useful things. Useful is often optional.

I've written some articles on [Opensource.com][1] about programming in C and Python. 

**JnyJny** is my abbreviation of the name "Johnny Johnny", a character from 1987 book "The Long Run" by Daniel Keys Moran. I adopted it as a login handle due to it's shortness compared to my given name.
